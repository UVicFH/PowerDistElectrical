# PowerDistElectrical
Schematic and PCB projects pertaining to power distribution. Sectioned into front power distribution and rear power distribution.

Power distribution project for 2017-2018 season. We want to ensure that each output has the correct voltage, and that the circuits are easier to debug by adding LEDs. We also want to replace components that are too small to solder accurately.
